We will concentrate on applications of contract theory and organizational economics. We will cover both theoretical and empirical research in these areas. The empirical work we cover focuses on food and agricultural markets; resource economics; development economics, and nutrition policy. One of the main objectives of the course is to strengthen students' research skills. ECON 2310 or equivalent, and ECON 3740 or equivalent are prerequisites to this course.
