We will concentrate on applications of contract theory and organizational economics. We will cover both theoretical and empirical research in these areas. The empirical work we will cover focuses on food and agricultural markets; resource economics; development economics, and nutrition policy. In addition, strengthening the research skills of students will be one of our main objectives. ECON 2310 or equivalent, and ECON 3740 or equivalent are prerequisites to this course.
