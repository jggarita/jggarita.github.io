This course concentrates on applications of contract theory and organizational economics. We cover both theoretical and empirical academic research in these areas. The empirical work we cover tends to focus on food and agricultural markets, but applications in other industries are also explored. One of the main objectives of the course is to strengthen students' research skills. ECON 2310 or equivalent, and ECON 3740 or equivalent are prerequisites to this course.
