[Working Paper](https://www.banxico.org.mx/publicaciones-y-prensa/documentos-de-investigacion-del-banco-de-mexico/%7BCC69ACEB-5595-C9BF-ED67-55A91C7E7BDD%7D.pdf).

This paper provides new evidence on the minimum wage impact on employment flows, using Costa Rica's distinctive occupation-based setting. I use administrative data from 2006-2017 to estimate firm-level minimum wage exposure and compute dynamic responses to the policy. Results indicate that firms increase their pay premiums in compliance with the policy. However, higher minimum wages have a negative and lasting effect on hiring rates and induce a temporary increase in separation rates. Job-to-job separation rates, on the contrary, decline after a minimum wage increase. I propose a wage-posting model with endogenous job creation to rationalize the results.
