I work as research economist at the Central Bank of Costa Rica. My primary research interests are labor economics, macroeconomics, and income tax policy. I earned my Ph.D. in Economics from The University of Texas at Austin.

My current work lies in the intersection between macroeconomics, labor, and public finances. Particularly, I have been studying how firms absorb higher minimum wages. Additionally, I am currently working on different taxation projects to understand agents’ behavior under non-linear budget sets introduced by notches.

I also teach at the Department of Economics of the University of Costa Rica.
