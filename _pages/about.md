I am a research economist at the Central Bank of Costa Rica and Assistant Professor at the University of Costa Rica. My primary research fields are macroeconomics and labor economics. I hold a Ph.D. in Economics from The University of Texas at Austin.

My current research focuses on analyzing dollarization decisions in dual currency economies, the response of firms to corporate tax complexity, and the impact of increasing minimum wages on firms.
