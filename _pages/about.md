I work as a Research Economist at the Central Bank of Costa Rica. My primary research interests include macroeconomics, labor markets, and income tax policy. I earned my Ph.D. in Economics from The University of Texas at Austin.

I am also an Associate Professor of Economics at the University of Costa Rica.
