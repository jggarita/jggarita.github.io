I am an economist currently working as an Assistant Professor for the [Department of Food, Agricultural, and Resource Economics](https://www.uoguelph.ca/fare/) at the [University of Guelph](https://www.uoguelph.ca/). I am broadly interested in Organizational, Experimental, and Agricultural Economics. 

I received a Ph.D. from [Purdue University](https://ag.purdue.edu/agecon/Pages/default.aspx) where I specialized in Agricultural Economics, Nonlinear Pricing, Contract Theory, and [Computational Science](https://www.purdue.edu/gradschool/cigp/). I have an M.S. in Applied Economics from the [University of Minnesota](https://www.apec.umn.edu/), and an undergraduate degree in Economics from the [Universidad de Guadalajara](http://www.cucea.udg.mx/) in Mexico.
